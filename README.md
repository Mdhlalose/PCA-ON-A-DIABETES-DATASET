# PCA-ON-A-DIABETES-DATASET

I will be using a dimensionality reduction algorithm called Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
The data I will be using was collected from the laboratory of Medical City Hospital and the Specializes Center for Endocrinology and Diabetes-Al-Kindy Teaching Hospital.
My intention with PCA is to be able to extract features that have a significant explained variance of the data, helping us discard the other features.
Afterward, plot the results to understand the correlation between the principal components.
The analysis of the results is within the pdf.
